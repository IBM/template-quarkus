# Quarkus microservice

In this sample application, you will create a basic Java web application using [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/). This provides a starting point for creating Java microservice applications running as a native application on GraalVM. It contains application code with a simple `/hello` endpoint, a swagger UI and a health check at `/health`.

## Steps

You can [deploy this application to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com) or [build it locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first. Once your app is live, you can access the `/hello` endpoint to build out your cloud native application.

### Deploying 

After you have created a new git repo from this git template, remember to rename the project.
Edit the `pom.xml` and change the `artifactId` from the default name to the name you used to create the template.

Make sure you are logged into the IBM Cloud using the IBM Cloud CLI and have access 
to you development cluster. If you are using OpenShift make sure you have logged into the OpenShift CLI on the command line.

Install the IBM Garage for Cloud CLI.
```$bash
npm i -g @garage-catalyst/ibm-garage-cloud-cli
```

Use the IBM Garage for Cloud CLI to register the GIT Repo 
```$bash
igc pipeline -n dev --tekton --pipeline ibm-java-maven 
```

See the **Deploy an app** guide in the [IBM Cloud-Native toolkit](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/) for details.

### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally you need to install
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* JDK 11+

Use the following command to build and run an application:

`./mvnw quarkus:dev`

## More Details

For more details on how to use this Starter Kit Template please review the [IBM Garage for Cloud Cloud-Native Toolkit Guide](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/)

### Creating this Starter Kit Template

This Starter Kit Template is based on Quarkus [Bootstrapping the project](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started#bootstrapping-the-project).

It was bootstrapped with the command:

```$bash
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:1.12.0.Final:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.ibm \
    -DprojectArtifactId=template-quarkus \
    -DclassName="com.ibm.GreetingResource" \
    -Dpath="/hello" \
    -Dextensions="smallrye-openapi, quarkus-resteasy-jsonb, quarkus-smallrye-opentracing"
```
#### OpenTracing
OpenTracing support was added automatically with `extensions="quarkus-smallrye-opentracing"` above.

Added properties to `src/main/resources/application.properties` file to configure tracing.
* `quarkus.jaeger.service-name` define the name of the service tracing is collected for. Update this name for your service.
* `quarkus.jaeger.sampler-type` use a constant sampling strategy.
* `quarkus.jaeger.sampler-param` sample all requests
* `quarkus.log.console.format` add trace IDs to the log messages. 

These properties can be set via environment variables instead.

Added Logger to `GreetingResource.java` to illustrate log messages with trace IDs.

#### OpenAPI and Swagger
OpenAPI and Swagger support was added automatically with the `extensions="smallrye-openapi"` above.
* Once your application is started, you can make a request to the `/q/openapi` endpoint to get the API Documentation.
* The Swagger UI can be located at `/q/swagger-ui`
* For more information on OpenAPI and Swagger support click [here](https://quarkus.io/guides/openapi-swaggerui)

#### Cloud-Native Toolkit

To add support for the [Cloud-Native Toolkit](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/) CI/CD pipelines 

1. the `Docker` file was added based on [this guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#using-a-multi-stage-docker-build).
2. The `.dockerignore` file was updated to remove the `*` line.
```$bash
# *
!target/*-runner
!target/*-runner.jar
!target/lib/*
!target/quarkus-app/*
```
3. The helm charts in the `chart` folder were added. 

#### Health check
Create the `/health` health check endpoint
1. Add the `/health` health check endpoint with the `src/main/java/com/ibm/HealthResource.java` file.
2. Add the health check test with the `src/test/java/com/ibm/HealthResourceTest.java` file.

#### SonarQube support

Support for running the [SonarQube CLI](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/) was added.  

1. The `sonar-project.properties` file was added. The values in this file should be updated to match your project.

2. The `pom.xml` file was modified to enable code coverage using JaCoCo based on [this guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/tests-with-coverage).  Changes to the file are:
    * Add `jacoco.version` property
    ```$bash
    <properties>
        ...
        <jacoco.version>0.8.6</jacoco.version>
    </properties>
    ```
    * Add the `jacoco-maven-plugin` plugin
    ```$bash
        </plugins>
        ....
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
            <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>${jacoco.version}</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>default-prepare-agent</id>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
                <execution>
                    <id>default-report</id>
                    <phase>test</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>report</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <configuration>
                        <dataFile>${project.build.directory}/jacoco.exec</dataFile>
                        <outputDirectory>${project.reporting.outputDirectory}/jacoco</outputDirectory>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
        </plugins>
    ```
